        <p className='mb-5'>Hi, I am Natalia.</p>

        <p className='mb-5'>
          Three years ago, I decided to change my career to front-end
          development. Since then, I have completed various courses, tutorials,
          and personal projects.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-5'>
          In the past time, I learned a lot of front-end technologies. React is
          my favorite.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-5'>
          As a self-taught developer, I did not follow a straight path. It was
          difficult to find good resources to learn. That is why I like to share
          my experiences and knowledge with other developers who are in the same
          situation.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-5'>
          Besides programming, I like to read books, exercise, play the piano,
          and travel the world.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-5'>
          I would love to hear from you. There is still much to be done.{' '}
